    "### **Colombia's Electricity Production Evolution And Recent Challenges** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy sector in Colombia has always been a priority in the country's agenda as one of the development and GDP drivers in Colombia's recent history. It is known that Colombia'S natural resources are abundant, and throughout its history, its become dependent on primary resources such as fossil fuels due to a lack of industrialized agriculture (20% of Colombia's income and almost 50% of exports).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Colombia has changed politics, threatening and boosting the probability of reaching its transition goal to clean energy and becoming a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gasses by 2050. Colombia's new president has sustainability at the top of his agenda. However, concerns of the global environmental community are increasing after Colombia's President announced a stop to fossil fuels. Below, we will look at trends in Colombia's renewable and non-renewable energy sources from 2000 to 2020, considering the following questions. Also, I've performed the same visualizations for South America and Colombia. \n",

    "- Are there any specific trends or anomalies in South America and Colombia's renewable electricity production?\n",
    "- How does renewable electricity production correlate with Colombia and South America's GDP over the years?\n",
    "- What types of renewable energy are most utilized in South America and Colombia? \n",
    "- How does the renewable electricity production in Colombia compare to the rest of South America?\n",
    "- How has the total renewable electricity production changed over time in South America?\n",
